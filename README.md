I built an innovative project called "Safe Space Friend," an Agentic AI Mental Health Support Chatbot. The system uses a multi-LLM architecture (GPT-4 as the router and Med-Gemini for clinical responses) built using LangGraph and LangChain. The agent is equipped with specialized tools, enabling it to accurately analyze a user’s emotional state and decide on the best intervention.

The coolest part was the Emergency Response Tool, which required integrating the system with the Twilio API. If the agent detects high-risk self-harm or suicidal language, it instantly executes an automated phone call to a registered emergency contact, moving beyond conversation to provide active, life-critical intervention. This demonstrated the successful implementation of real-world actionability in a sensitive AI application.
